        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living
          God. Welcome to the second edition of
          <strong>"GOD IS W.O.R.D."</strong> — where we embrace the Word of God
          not merely as written text, but as His living, breathing presence
          active in our everyday walk. Through community, study, and praise, we
          seek to understand the heartbeat of heaven and respond with faith and
          obedience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dive into the depths of Scripture with us and witness its power to
          transform hearts, restore lives, and guide us through every season.
          The Word is not distant — it is alive, it is near, and it is speaking.
          <br /><em
